"""SMART App Launch (EHR launch) scaffold: GET /smart/launch?iss=...&launch=... is the URL an EMR
opens SynexAgent with, carrying the FHIR server base (iss) and an opaque launch token the EMR
expects back during token exchange so it can hand over patient context.

This builds a spec-shaped authorization redirect with PKCE (code_verifier/code_challenge, state)
and a callback that exchanges the code for a token. It has NOT been exercised against a real EMR's
SMART launcher or a real FHIR authorization server -- there isn't one reachable here. Verified here
only via unit tests that the redirect URL and PKCE parameters are constructed correctly
(backend/tests/test_cds_hooks.py); the actual authorization round-trip is unverified.

State is kept in one of two backends, chosen at import time:

- SYNEX_REDIS_URL set: `_RedisLaunchStore`, backed by a real Redis instance (a launch's state is
  shared by every worker process/replica that points at the same Redis, and each entry expires on
  its own after LAUNCH_TTL_SECONDS -- no cleanup job needed). This is the one a real multi-worker
  deployment should use; verified here against a real `redis-server` process
  (backend/tests/test_smart_launch_redis.py), not just a mock.
- otherwise: `_LaunchStore`, a local SQLite file (default backend/data/smart_launch.sqlite3,
  override with SYNEX_SMART_LAUNCH_PATH). Fine for a single-instance demo deployment and survives a
  process restart there, but does NOT survive across multiple worker processes/replicas sharing no
  filesystem -- this is the one real limitation left once SYNEX_REDIS_URL is set: without it, a
  multi-worker deployment still needs Redis (or a real shared DB) to keep an in-flight SMART launch
  visible to whichever worker handles the callback.
